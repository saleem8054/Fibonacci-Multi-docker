This is simple web application responsible for calculating Fibonacci series at any index.
You can know more by looking at the pictures namely development-architecture,development-flow and production-achitecture.

It uses AWS Relational Database Service and AWS Elastic cache as different services for data stores.
The application was deployed on AWS for sometime but then removed, because I run another project in AWS because of limitations in free tier.

The application will soon be deployed again but that time in Google Cloud and it will use Kubernetes.
